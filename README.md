I created a project that takes inspiration from a design flash card styudy app exercise. For this
exercise we designed the app but did not implement in React Native. The application will allow
users to create and view study card decks. There will be three screens home, add, and study
that will be organized by using the Bottom Tabs and Stack collections form React Navigation.
