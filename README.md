I created a project that takes inspiration from a design flash card styudy app exercise. For this exercise we designed the app but did not implement in React Native. The application will allow users to create and view study card decks. There will be three screens home, add, and study that will be organized by using the Bottom Tabs and Stack collections form React Navigation.
